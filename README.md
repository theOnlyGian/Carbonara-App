### What is this app about?
This is a simple app that lets you search and view food plates. You can view the food, the ingredients and the details.
I used Django webframework along with html, scss, javascript and [edamam's food api](https://www.edamam.com/)
I created this app to learn about:
- Promises and async functions in javascript
- SCSS
- Fetch data from an api and a database
- Favicons
